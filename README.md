# The Last Resort

If you're following best practices to keep yourself safe online, you probably have two-factor authentication enabled on all of your most important online accounts. However, this also means that you could lose access to those accounts if something happens to your two-factor device.

Suppose that you're using your phone as your 2FA device, and you haven't stored any backup codes (such a pain to keep!) or backed up your 2FA keys somewhere else. What would happen if something happened to your phone? Maybe it gets lost or stolen, or breaks without warning. You could be in for a lot of frustration.

Fortunately, there are ways to prevent your phone from being a single point of failure to accessing all your online accounts. You could use a third-party service such as [Authy](https://authy.com/) or [LastPass Authenticator](https://lastpass.com/auth/) that lets you sync your 2FA codes across multiple devices. That way, as long as you have one device still working, you'll still be able to bootstrap your online account access in the event of a disaster.

But what if all of your electronics are destroyed at once? Say, for example, your home is flooded or destroyed in a fire and you aren't able to save any of your devices. That's where **The Last Resort** comes in â€“ as a last resort.
